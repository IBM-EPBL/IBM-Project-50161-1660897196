               Nowadays, a lot of money is being wasted in the car insurance business due to leakage claims. Claims
               leakage Underwriting leakage is characterized as the discrepancy between the actual payment of claims
               made and the sum that should have been paid if all of the industry's leading practices were applied.
               Visual examination and testing have been used to may these results. However, they impose delays in the
               processing of claims. The aim of this project is to build a VGG16 model that can detect the area of
               damage on a car. The rationale for such a model is that it can be used by insurance companies for faster
               processing of claims if users can upload pics and the model can assess damage( be it dent scratch from
               and estimates the cost of damage. This model can also be used by lenders if they are underwriting a car
               loan, especially for a used car.
